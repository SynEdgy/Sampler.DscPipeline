# Changelog for Sampler.DscPipeline

The format is based on and uses the types of changes according to [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Adding pipeline tasks and commands from DSC Workshop.
- Small changes to support easier deployment for individual environments.
- Added scripts for compiling MOF and Meta MOF files without the need for the `rootConfig.ps1` script. It is now a self-contained task that takes parameters from the `Build.yml`.
- Having modules available more than once results in: ImportCimAndScriptKeywordsFromModule : "A second CIM class definition
  for 'MSFT_PSRepository' was found while processing the schema file". Fixed that by using function 'Get-DscResourceFromModuleInFolder'.
  This usually happens with 'PackageManagement' and 'PowerShellGet'
- The handling of the DSC MOF compilation has changed. The file 'RootConfiguration.ps1' is still used when present in the source of
  the DSC project that uses 'Sampler.DscPipeline'. Same applies to the Meta MOF compilation script 'RootMetaMof.ps1'. If these
  files don't exist, 'Sampler.DscPipeline' uses the scripts in 'ModuleRoot\Scripts'. To control which DSC composite and resource modules should be imported within the DSC configuration, add the section 'Sampler.DscPipeline' to the 'build.yml' as described
  on top of the file 'CompileRootConfiguration.ps1'.
- Added error handling discovering 'CompileRootConfiguration.ps1' and 'RootMetaMof.ps1'
- Test cases updated to Pester 5.
- Fixing issue with ZipFile class not being present
