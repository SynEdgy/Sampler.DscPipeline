Welcome to the documentation wiki for the Sampler DSC Pipeline

# Usage

The `Sampler.DscPipeline` PowerShell module is an extension to [Sampler](github.com/synedgy/Sampler),
providing tasks to implement a DSC pipeline to create DSC artefacts as used in the 
[DSC Workshop](https://github.com/dsccommunity/DscWorkshop).
